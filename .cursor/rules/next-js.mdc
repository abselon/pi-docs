# Next.js Static Site Rules

## Configuration
- Next.js app is located in `apps/web/`
- Configured for static export (`output: 'export'`)
- TypeScript enabled

## Development Guidelines
- Use App Router (app directory) for routing
- Follow Next.js best practices for static site generation
- Optimize images using Next.js Image component
- Use environment variables for configuration

## Build and Deployment
- Static export generates files in `apps/web/out/`
- Ensure all routes are statically generated where possible
- Test static export locally before deployment
- Document any dynamic features that require runtime configuration
